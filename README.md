# Octo-Valley-Randomizer
A randomizer for Splatoon 1's Octo Valley singleplayer campaign.

Extremely WIP; Currently supports randomizing kettles, ink colors, mission dialogue, and hero weapons with a basic GUI.

Requires Python 3.12: Currently requires PyQt5, ruamel.yaml, PyLibMS and oead, all of which can be installed from pip.
